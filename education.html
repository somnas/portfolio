            I'm currently studying webdeveloper fullstack open source at Nackademin in Stockholm.<br>
            Fullstack means that I'm learning the processes and strategies of both front and back-end development. We are learning to solve problems in small teams by utilizing methods like SCRUM and others used by companies today to prepare for what we will face in our future employments.
